### 1.  Normalizing data

This question uses this table:
![Not normalized data](http://www.essentialsql.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Intro-Table-Not-Normalized.png)

from the lecture notes.  For each answer, please explain as fully as possible, and feel free to use tables or diagrams if you prefer.

a)  Why does this table violate the first normal form, and what would be required to make it 1NF?

[your answer]

b)  What additional steps would be needed to make the table 2NF, and why?

[your answer]

c)  Why might we not want to normalize data to the fullest extent possible?

[your answer]

d)  In the table below, which of the three normalization rules does this violate, if any, and why?

   |  countryID  |  countryName    |   EUmember   |  EUjoindate  |
   | -----------:|:----------------|:------------:|:------------:|
   | 00001       | France          |  `true`      |  1958-01-01  |
   | 00004       | Hungary         |  `true`      |  2004-05-01  |
   | 00003       | Serbia          |  `false`     |       `NULL` |
   | 00004       | Finland         |  `true`      |  1995-01-01  |
   | 00005       | Russia          |  `false`     |       `NULL` |
   | 00006       | Ireland, UK     |  `true`      |  1973-01-01  |

   Are there any other problems with the table, besides normalization?

[your answer]

e)  What would it take to full (1NF-3NF) normalize this dataset?

   Write out these tables, and describe why this meets each of the normal forms.  This is a database of movies watched on NetBricks, a streaming movie service.

   | Name           | Address    |   Movies Rented   |  Salutation  | Category |
   |:---------------|:-----------|:------------------|:------------:|----------|
   | Bob Smith      | 1 Houghton Street    | _Star Wars_, _Inception_ |  Dr.   |  Scifi, Scifi |
   | Pry Ministair  | 10 Downing St     |  _Brexit the Movie_      |  Lady  | Tragedy |
   | Joe Bloggs     | 8 Myhatt St.      |  _Fast and Furious 6_, _Fast and Furious 7_     | Mr. | Action, Action |

### 2.  Reshaping data

For this exercise, we will use the **nycflights13** R package, whose tables have been output in `.csv` form [here](nycflights13/).  You may do the following in either R or Python.  Note that this example is developed extensively in [_R for Data Science_](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html).

a)  Create a subtable of the `flights` data, that departed before 05:53 on 2013-02-28.  How many rows and columns does this subtable have?  

```{r}
library("dplyr")
library("lubridate")

flights <- read.csv("nycflights13/flights.csv")

flights$dep_datetime <- ymd_hm(sprintf("%s-%02d-%02d %02d:%02d",
                            flights$year,
                            flights$month,
                            flights$day,
                            flights$hour,
                            flights$minute))
flights_sub <- subset(flights, dep_datetime < ymd_hm("2013-02-28 05:53"))

nrow(flights_sub)
```

b)  Merge or join the subtable from a. `flights` data, to produce a result that includes:  
   *  Departure time
   *  Carrier (two digit code, from `carrier`)
   *  Flight number
   *  Destination airport name (hint: you will need to get this from the `airports` table)  

```{r}
## your code
```

c) **(optional)** For every airline that had flights in the `flights` data compute the average age of the planes it flew from the entire dataset.  Age here will be defined as 2013 minus the `year` variable from the `planes` data.  Hint: This involves a join operation on `tailnum`, but also a grouped mean to compute the age (and subtracting 2013, which you can do before or after the computation of the mean).


```{r}
## your code
```

### 3.  Working with SQL

a)  Create a relational dataset in SQLite using the `.csv` data found [here](nycflights13/).  Name each table so that it matches the base filenames of the input data.  You can use DB Browser for this, but describe how you did it, but the answer will use the R package [RSQLite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSQLite/RSQLite.pdf). 

[your answer]

b)  Replicate B2 above using an SQL query, including both the command and the output.

[your answer]

c) **(optional)** Replicate B3 above using an SQL query, including both the command and the output.
